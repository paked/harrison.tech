We had a weekend set aside, a meeting point (Albury), a theme (cycle-camping), but no plan for how we would actually spend our time. While convened on a park bench, chowing through 2x pizzas and 2x cash-only HSPs, our group of three picked a local rail trail to explore for the following two days.

So: [Murray to Mountains](https://www.ridehighcountry.com.au/rail-trails/murray-to-mountains/) it was.

Oh, also, this post takes place in early May.

## Day 1 (Yak to Bright to Everton)

Having slept the night in Yak inside Seb's fancy tent, freezing my ass off (I forgot to close my vestibule door before falling asleep), I was not super pleased to hear our 6:30 alarm. However, I knew two things: I would soon be eating a tasty Pumpkin Curry pie, and I had a weekend of cycling with my mates before me. Two very good things.

After eating our hearty breakfast we started our cycle up the road aiming for Bright (roughly 100km away). Less than 10 minutes in we suffered our first and only mechanical. A flat tire. Flashbacks to our first ever 100km cycle (done over 10 hours, and with 10 flats) many years ago ensued, I was deeply and needlessly concerned for the rest of the day.

While the legs warmed up, we bantered and enjoyed the weather as it morphed from a Melbourne rain spit to some Canberran dry sun. When cycling I go to pretty great lengths to avoid riding on tarmac with cars, but Seb and Tali usually just suck-it-up. We broke out of the Yak hole and started flying downhill to our next climb into Beechworth. I think it was at this point my friends began to understand the beauty of rail trail. No cars, generally pretty scenery, and train-based history.

Despite the rail trail name it's pretty easy to forget that rail trails actually once had trains on them, so it was quite nice to run into the old Everton station (described as "very epic"). We made like trains and shunted ourselves from the Everton->Yak line, to the Wangaratta->Everton->Bright line (when on rail, as they say).

Reaching Everton meant it was (basically) all uphill to Bright. Fortunately, for the most part, it was the sort of uphill which you forget is uphill. You just question why it feels just that little bit harder to hit your normal "flat road" speed.

We stopped at a bakery in Myrtleford (on the way in we passed a lot of tourists admiring the amazing autumn leaves of the trees on the main road), and each consumed a real medley of bakery food. I had a schnitzel burger, an apple slice, and shared a bowl of wedges. Tali and Seb were pleased my attitude vis-Ã -vis generally cooking/assembling each meal myself while travelling had been put on hold for the weekend.

Battling a head wind we tried to lay some serious tracks into Bright. Seb noticed a beer smell and started chatting up a factory worker to see if he could get any beer (turns out they were a hops grower, so no beer to give away). Unfortunately it was quite a smoggy day so we were denied a view of my favourite mountain range (sorry Kosci).

The Bright railway museum had closed 10 minutes before its official 4pm time. This was a little disappointing, but the old station was still interesting to look in on. We had considered originally continuing on 20km to Smoko (a favourite campsite of mine), but decided to turn around at this point and see if we could make some progress back towards Yak. We were basically doing an out-and-back on the rail trail with Bright as the turn around point, so any distance we covered tonight would be distance we didn't need to do tomorrow. With loose plans to stay in a dodgy shelter (which Ned Kelly had apparently passed through) or a train station, we decided to see how far we could make it.

We lit up our bikes like Christmas trees as the sun set and headed in towards Myrtleford once more, this time seeking dinner. We had reached 30 bonus kilometers. One burger, and one conversation on the existential reason as to why we were going to cycle in the dark instead of finding somewhere to camp later (Seb: likes pain, Tali: confused, Harrison: is having fun so whatever).

The night cycling brought back memories of late night runs while training for [IB](https://anuinwardbound.com), and so we continued longer than we thought we would, all the way to Everton where there was a (legal) free campsite. Another 30 bonus kilometers.

Overall, we clocked 160kms that day making it the longest distance covered I'd covered single ride. I wasn't feeling too poorly either.

I went to bed in my trusty $150 Nature Hike Outdoors tent, with no extra luxurious vestible for me to forget to close. Perfect.

## Day 2 (Everton to Yak)

We woke up in the morning, packed up camp, and dropped into the Everton General Store to buy some breakfast. After consuming some Egg and Bacon rolls (and, for one of us, a milkshake) we started the longest climb of the trip up into Beechworth. Although, generally, if a train can do it it can't be too bad[^1].

While the legs took a little longer to warm up than the day before, I found myself spinning up the hill at a comfortable pace, reflecting on how nice it was to get away with my mates and have an adventure.

And then, too soon, we found ourselves in Yak. We each ate a Pumpkin Curry pie.

## Final route

This is a sealed rail trail, you can ride basically anything on it. We had a road bike, a touring bike, and my rigid Mountain Bike. It's very accessible on the VLine from Melbourne (a 3 hour train ride to Wangaratta). There's food everywhere, and water everywhere, and camping everywhere.

I've annotated the route below with what we used. There's plenty of other facilities though.

Hills, beaches, tourists, forests (including plantations, and national parks), good campsites, bad campsites, new friends, rail trails. The Otway Rip has it all, and it's all accessible via a train from Melbourne.

Since moving to Melbourne I was super excited to go bikepacking, and with my partner Niamh a recent convert, we thought we'd use my week of leave to go on an adventure.

Initially I planned my own route with ridewithgps in the Otway area. But, the more I vetted the details, the more problems I found (Old Beechy Rail trail is partially closed, I had picked a "hell road" from the Dirty Warny). Our goal with this trip was to have a holiday. We wanted to cook nice food, swim, and see some nature. Fortunately, The Otway Rip was already well scouted by others. The elevation profile on the last few days was a little intimidating, but we figured we'd go slow. We also figured we'd take as much time as we could, instead of trying to keep to the 3-4 day schedule.

We generally aimed for 60km days.

## The gear

I'm riding my Surly Bridge Club. I had a Frame bag, a seat pack, and a dry-bag/tent combo strapped to my handlebars.

Niamh was on a trusty 26er Giant 90s MTB. She packed with 2 panniers, and a dry-bag strapped to her handlebars ("The Euro Special" if you will).

We slept in a Nature Hike CloudUp 2 person tent.

We cooked on a Trangia.

I have a shitty iPhone 8 with terrible battery, so we used a Garmin Edge 530 to navigate with. Short review is: I love this thing. Pro tips: turn on battery saver mode, and make sure the screen only shows up when a turn is coming up. This way you are forced to look at Nature, and the 530 will drain like 15% battery per day.

## The trip

### Day 1 (Camperdown to Port Campbell)

**60km, rail trail city**

We woke up bright and early and caught the 7am Wanambool trail to Camperdown. The train was pleasant, we napped and watched the scenery change.

Once we arrived in Camperdown we hunted down a bakery to get a proper breakfast from, and then filled up our water. We made it 50m of actual cycling before realising Niamh's brake pads were rubbing. Quick fix, then back on the road again.

You can make it from Camperdown to Port Campbell entirely on rail trail (apart from the first few kms out of Camperdown, but that's pretty quite road). It's quite an interesting and varied cycle. You've got your standard rail trail fare, but also some lush forest sections (where you can see the actual overgrown rail line!). It's also mostly down hill, which is nice, but "what goes down must come up". The section from Timboon to Port Cambell seems to be a recent addition, and wasn't in the Otway Rip GPX, but I would recommend riding on it.

We stayed at the Port Campbell rec reserve, hot showers and charging were abound (as well as vans of belting-showtunes-in-the-middle-of-the-night tourists). We ate a bad pizza for dinner.

### Day 2 (Port Campbell to bush camp)

**60km, pretty flat, portions of track sandy as hell**

The traditional Otway Rip route follows the Great Ocean Road from Port Campbell to Princetown for this section (roughly 20km).

While vetting my failed personal course I found a deviation on the local council for "mountain bikers and gravel cyclists" who wanted to continue the rail-train lifestyle from Port Campbell to the 12 Apostles (most of the way towards Princetown).

We decided to take this deviation instead of riding along the Great Ocean Road.

Leaving the campsite and turning left onto a road which almost immediately turned into sand was a bit of a shock. However, we composed ourselves and marched on--very thankful Niamh had borrowed the 26er MTB over her normal commuter/gravel bike.

After 10km of the sand we came across a grader who was fixing up the road coming the other direction. The man operating it was very nice, and a little apologetic he hadn't gone quicker! All was well, and we were appreciative of the graders handywork as we continued on this back-road.

A smidge of climbing later (slow enough for bugs to start to attack), we bombed a beautiful dirt descent down into the 12 Apostles. It's a tourist classic for a reason. The south-eastern coast of Australia is truly a beautiful place. We ate a vegetable curry pie and a Timboon sorbet as a snack, both were great.

The road riding from 12 Apostles to Princetown was uneventful, but I've since noticed there's another council deviation on their website. If I was going again I'd maybe do it!

Arriving at Princetown was almost sad. This place was a ghost town. The road we followed through the marsh back in-land was similarly beautiful, despite the fact this unique seeming land had been cow-ified.

Our desire to keep to 60km days meant that we knew we would be bush-camping on this night. We had a pretty strong aversion to camping in a paddock, and so aimed for a corner of the Otway National Park which we brushed past at KM 58. Tired and weary we found a campsite in a small clearing off an old management trail. We ate Tom-Yum soup for dinner.

### Day 3 (bush camp to Johannes Beach, half day)

This day had the first big climb of the trip. We climbed up to Lavers Hill over 15km. We'd been practicing "spinning is winning", and the technique payed off. Meandering our way up, chatting, and we enjoyed being in cool the forest greatly.

We triumphantly reached Lavers Hill, and ordered a serve of Pancakes and a serve of chips. The stuff legends are made of.

Given our bush camp the night before, we were pretty low on water with 2L between the pair of us.

* Beautiful descent
* Beach
* Caravaners checking we were okay

We ate TVP-and-mushroom pasta for dinner.

### Day 4 (Johannes Beach to Beauchamp Falls)

* Running into Ema
* Fixing niamh's derailleur
* Terrible campsite and pirate metal

### Day 5 (Beauchamp Campsite to Lake Elizabeth)

### Day 6 (rest day)

Lake Elizabeth to Forrest

We had a vego burger for dinner

### Day 7

Forrest to Birriguerra (sic?)

## Thinking back

What worked well?

* We started our trip the day public schools went back in Victoria. Doing any of the road riding doing peak times would be awful.
* Aussie butt cream.

What would I change?
